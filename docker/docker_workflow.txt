# This file contains how to run the dagster example the 
# "manual" way (ie without Docker Compose) and also using
# Docker Compose

# See this YouTube video for background info on running multiple
# containers manually vs using Docker compose
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE&t=5389s

# Since we will be running 2 containers that need to "talk"
# to each other, we need to create a Docker network
sudo docker network create dagster-sklearn-network

# Navigate to folder that has the Dockerfile_daemon and Dockerfile_dagit files
# Now build the Docker images for running dagit and daemon
sudo docker build -t dagster-sklearn -f Dockerfile_dagit .
sudo docker build -t dagster-daemon -f Dockerfile_daemon .

# Create a "named" Docker volume where we would like to persist
# the sqlite databases that dagster will generate
sudo docker volume create dagster-db

# Run docker container in detached mode with the following options/specifications:
#     which will delete itself after shutting down,
#     will map a "named" host file system to container's file system
#     will map host port 3000 to container's port 3000
#     give the container a custom name: dagster-dagit
#     will use the docker network defined earlier
#     image name: dagster-sklearn 
sudo docker run -d \
    --rm \
    -v dagster-db:/dagster-sklearn/.dagster \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --name dagster-dagit \
    --net dagster-sklearn-network \
    dagster-sklearn 

# Run docker container in detached mode with the following options/specifications:
#     which will delete itself after shutting down,
#     will map a "named" host file system to container's file system
#     give the container a custom name: dagster-daemon
#     will use the docker network defined earlier
#     image name: dagster-daemon
sudo docker run -d \
    --rm \
    -v dagster-db:/dagster-sklearn/.dagster \
    --name dagster-daemon \
    --net dagster-sklearn-network \
    dagster-daemon


# Running example using Docker Compose
# Assuming both the dagit and daemon Docker images have been built,
# navigate to the folder that has the dagster-docker-compose.yaml file
sudo docker-compose -f dagster-docker-compose.yaml up

# Shutdown the running instances of dagit and daemon
sudo docker-compose -f dagster-docker-compose.yaml down

# Docker tips

# Start a docker container
docker start <containerid_or_name>

# Stop a docker container
docker stop <containerid_or_name>

# Generate list of running and not running docker containers
docker ps -a 

# View last part of the logs
docker logs <containerid_or_name> | tail

# Stream the logs instead
docker logs <containerid_or_name> -f

# Docker volume
sudo docker volume create <volume_name>
sudo docker volume inspect <volumn_name>
sudo docker volume ls
sudo docker volumn rm <volume_name>

# sh or start bash terminal inside the running docker container
# so that you can take a peek into folders, generate list
# of environment variables, etc
docker exec -it <containerid_or_name> sh
or 
docker exec -it <containerid_or_name> /bin/bash
