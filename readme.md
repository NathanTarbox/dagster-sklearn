# A trivial, contrived example of using Dagster to build a scikit-learn pipeline

## PURPOSE
Create a dagster example that is a little more complex than your typical
"hello world" examples, but not too complex that would overwhelm
someone new to workflow management libraries or "pipeline as code".  Yet,
it is an example that is practical enough where we are extracting data,
transforming data, and then providing an end result.
